# Night Vision Data

 Night Vision Data is a web app that will mostly work with Governments data to make informations more Open and Presentable to citizens and society so that they can clearly understand whatâ€™s happening under the hood.
 This plateform will help 'unjailing' the data. A sort of collaborative data crowdsourcing.

 * People will find data in the format of PDF or Image ... and they will collaborate to make it in an exploitable format
 * We will start by creating a crowdsourcing Plateform for the Tunisian municipal election of 06-05-2018 and we will try to make it as generic as possible to extend the crowdsourcing to different other data.
